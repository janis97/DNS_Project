DNS_Project      
===========

#### INTRODUCTION
After 5 years of existence, Mirakl has been hosting many environments for its customers. Some of these environments have been created long ago, while some are very recent. Some environments have been deleted for a long time, while other are unused but still up.

Each and every one is accessed through HTTP, and as such needs its own DNS name. Often the environment deletion has left behind a DNS record that is no longer needed. 

The first objective of this project is to list DNS records that could deleted.

Let's go :smiley:
